      <description>I am an academician cum a scientist with a background in medicine. Currently, I am an Associate Professor in a large medical school in a well known public university in Malaysia. I am also a gazetted Public Health Physician.
I am interested in disease modelling using the right blend of epidemiological and statistical modelling, intuitive data analysis and proper research designs. I obtained my Doctor of Medicine degree, then later the post graduate Masters In Community Medicine (Epidemiology and Biostatistics).</description>
